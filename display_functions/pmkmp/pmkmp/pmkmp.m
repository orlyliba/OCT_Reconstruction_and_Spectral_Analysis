function map=pmkmp(n,scheme)% PMKMP Returns perceptually balanced colormaps with rainbow-like colors%   PMKMP(N,SCHEME) returns an Nx3 colormap. %   usage: map=pmkmp(n,scheme);%% JUSTIFICATION: rainbow, or spectrum color schemes are considered a poor% choice for scientific data display by many in the scientific community% (see for example reference 1 and 2) in that they introduce artifacts % that mislead the viewer. "The rainbow color map appears as if it’s separated% into bands of almost constant hue, with sharp transitions between hues. % Viewers perceive these sharp transitions as sharp transitions in the data,% even when this is not the casein how regularly spaced (interval) data are% displayed (quoted from reference 1). This submission is intended to share% the results of my work to create more perceptually balanced, % rainbow-like color maps.

If lighting is combined with a%     colormap that has its own lightness function associated - even as%     simple as a linear increase this will confuse the viewer.

L* ranges between 31 and 90 in the violet to yellowish %      portion of the colormap, then decreases to about 80 to get %      to the red (please refer to figure L_a_b_PlotsCubicL.png).%      The choice to start at 31 was a matter of taste. %      I like having violet instead of black at the cold end of the%      colormap. The latter choice was so as to have red and not%      white at the warm end  of the colorbar, which is also a %      matter of personal taste. As a result,  there is an inversion in %      the L* trend, but I believe because it is a smooth one that%      this is an acceptable compromise and the resulting%      colormap is much of an improvement over the standard %      rainbow or spectrum schemes, which  typically have at least 3 sharp %      L* inversions.
